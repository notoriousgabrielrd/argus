  Control an Android emulator / device from inside Argus using the `orca` CLI.
  Use for listing/booting AVDs, taps, swipes, typing, hardware buttons (incl. Back
  and Recents), rotation, app install/launch, runtime permissions, the accessibility
  tree, and logcat — driving a real adb-connected device or emulator. Cross-platform
  (Windows, Linux, macOS). Complements the orca-emulator (iOS) and orca-cli skills.

# Argus Emulator (Android)

This file is a discovery stub, not the usage guide. The full, version-matched Argus Android
emulator reference is served by the `orca` binary itself — kept out of this file on purpose
so it can never drift from the binary that will actually run your commands.

Engage Argus whenever you drive an adb-connected Android emulator or device from inside the
Argus app: listing/booting AVDs, taps, swipes, typing, hardware buttons (including Back and
Recents), rotation, app install/launch, runtime permissions, the accessibility tree, and
logcat. It is cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) and complements the orca-emulator (iOS)
and orca-cli skills.

## Resolve the CLI for this session

Choose the executable once and reuse it for every later command:

- If the `ORCA_CLI_COMMAND` environment variable is set, use its value. Argus exports this
  for managed WSL sessions.
- Otherwise, in a dev checkout whose session exposes `ORCA_DEV_REPO_ROOT`, use `argus-dev`.
- Otherwise, use `argus`, which is the command name on every platform.

If you find a bare `orca` on PATH, it is not this CLI: that is the GNOME Orca screen reader
(`/usr/bin/orca`), and running it starts speech on the user's machine.

Below, `ORCA` is a placeholder for the executable you resolved. Substitute it before
running anything; do not create a shell variable or run `ORCA` literally. This works the
same way in POSIX shells, PowerShell, and cmd.exe.

If the selected executable cannot run, report its exact error and stop. Do not fall through
to another executable, which could silently target a different Argus build.

## Load the full guide before running Argus commands

```text
ORCA skills get orca-emulator-android
```

That prints the complete, version-matched guide for the exact binary that will handle your
next commands — booting AVDs, taps and swipes, typing, hardware buttons, app lifecycle,
permissions, the accessibility tree, and logcat. Read it first, then run the specific
command you need.

Don't guess subcommands or flags from memory or from a cached copy of this stub. They
change between Argus releases, and this file deliberately no longer lists them. Confirm the
app is up with `ORCA status --json` (start it with `ORCA open --json` if needed), and
prefer `--json` for agent-driven calls.

## If an older Argus does not recognize `skills get`

Use this fallback only when the selected binary explicitly reports that `skills get` is an
unknown command. Another failure is not proof of an older binary; report it rather than
guessing or changing executables. For a confirmed pre-guide binary, use only this bounded,
read-only bootstrap to orient. Do not dead-end and do not invent commands:

```text
ORCA status --json
ORCA emulator devices --json
```

Then tell the user that updating Argus restores the full, version-matched guide via
`ORCA skills get orca-emulator-android`. Beyond these commands, ask the user rather than
guessing a command surface this older binary may not support.
